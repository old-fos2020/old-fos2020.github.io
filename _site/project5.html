<p><strong>Hand in:</strong> 18 Dec 2020, 23:59 (Europe/Zurich)<br />
<strong>Project template:</strong> <a href="projects/5-inference.zip">5-inference.zip</a></p>

<p>In this exercise, you will write a Hindley-Milner type inferencer for a modification of the simply typed λ-calculus
with booleans, numbers and <code class="highlighter-rouge">let</code>:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>t ::= "true"                            true value
    | "false"                           false value
    | numericLit                        integer
    | "pred" t                          predecessor
    | "succ" t                          successor
    | "iszero" t                        iszero
    | "if" t "then" t "else" t          if
    | x                                 variable
    | "\" x [ ":" T ] "." t             abstraction
    | t t                               application (left associative)
    | "let" x [ ":" T ] "=" t "in" t    let
    | "(" t ")"

T ::= "Bool"                            boolean type
    | "Nat"                             numeric type
    | T "-&gt;" T                          function types  (right associative)
    | "(" T ")"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The main difference with the usual STLC is that the type annotations for lambdas and for <code class="highlighter-rouge">let</code> are optional
(which is expressed by the square brackets around them in the syntax spec).
This means that the programmer can either explicitly specify types for introduced variables
or leave them empty to be inferred by the typechecker.</p>

<h3 id="type-inference-101">Type Inference 101</h3>

<p>Unlike the typecheckers in projects #3 and #4 that went top-down on input abstract syntax trees
and assigned types in one pass, this one is going to be more involved, featuring two phases:</p>

<ol>
  <li>During the first phase, our Hindley-Milner typechecker will recursively collect constraints on the types of expressions present in the input tree.</li>
  <li>Afterwards in the second phase, it is going to solve these constraints, either producing the resulting type or failing with an error.</li>
</ol>

<p>Below we will explain how this works in details, essentially recapping what’s written in TAPL.
The methodology that has been presented during the lecture on type reconstruction and polymorphism
is somewhat different, but in fact it talks about exactly the same thing. While implementing the type inferencer,
take time to understand how both approaches relate to the code that you’re writing,
because you’ll need to know both on the upcoming exam.</p>

<p><em>You may wonder how what we’re doing is related to the real world. The general notion of type inference
is very powerful and a lot of languages (C#, Java, C++, F#, Scala, Haskell, Swift, Rust and many others) employ it.
However, different languages do inference differently, and the most popular approach, called local type inference,
doesn’t involve anything like Hindley-Milner. Nevertheless, some languages (F# and Haskell among the aforementioned ones)
employ algorithms that resemble Hindley-Milner, so our project will let you develop useful intuitions.</em></p>

<h3 id="phase-1-collecting-constraints">Phase 1: Collecting constraints</h3>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">def collect(env: Env, t: Term): (Type, List[Constraint]) = ???</code></p>

<p>The basic idea of the first phase is to recursively apply typing rules on the input tree, just as in projects #3/4.
However, this time the rules are not just <code class="highlighter-rouge">Γ ⊢ t : T</code>, but look like <code class="highlighter-rouge">Γ ⊢ t : T | C</code>, where <code class="highlighter-rouge">C</code> stands for a constraint set.
Without further ado, here are the typing rules for STLC augmented with constraints (you may want to look into p322 of TAPL
for a better formatted version):</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Γ ⊢ true : Bool | {}

Γ ⊢ false : Bool | {}

Γ ⊢ 0 : Nat | {}

Γ ⊢ t : T | C    C' = C ∪ {T=Nat}
---------------------------------
    Γ ⊢ pred t : Nat | C'

Γ ⊢ t : T | C    C' = C ∪ {T=Nat}
---------------------------------
    Γ ⊢ succ t : Nat | C'

Γ ⊢ t : T | C    C' = C ∪ {T=Nat}
---------------------------------
   Γ ⊢ iszero t : Bool | C'

 Γ ⊢ t1: T1 | C1    Γ ⊢ t2 : T2 | C2
          Γ ⊢ t3 : T3 | C3
  C = C1 ∪ C2 ∪ C3 ∪ {T1=Bool, T2=T3}
-------------------------------------
  Γ ⊢ if t1 then t2 else t3 : T2 | C

   x : T ∈ Γ
--------------
Γ ⊢ x : T | {}

   Γ, x : T1 ⊢ t : T2 | C
-----------------------------
Γ ⊢ λx: T1. t : T1 -&gt; T2 | C

 Γ, x : X ⊢ t : T2 | C
      X is fresh
------------------------
Γ ⊢ λx. t : X -&gt; T2 | C

 Γ ⊢ t1 : T1 | C1    Γ ⊢ t2 : T2 | C2
X is fresh, C = C1 ∪ C2 ∪ {T1=T2 -&gt; X}
--------------------------------------
        Γ ⊢ t1 t2 : X | C
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>An interesting thing about the presented typing rules is that they involve type variables. If you take a look at the last rule,
you will notice that when typechecking applications, we don’t check whether <code class="highlighter-rouge">t1</code> has a function type.
Instead, we just postulate that it has a function type <code class="highlighter-rouge">T2 -&gt; X</code> for some <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> that we’ll infer later.
Same about typechecking a lambda with an unspecified type of the bound variable.</p>

<p>This is the key insight behind the Hindley-Milner algorithm.
If you don’t know the type of something immediately by looking at it, you defer typechecking until you know more.
Amazingly enough, this simple idea is theoretically sound and works really well in practice!</p>

<p>One little remark about theory vs practice. If you compare our rules with the ones given in TAPL, you will notice that we have ignored freshness conditions on type variables: it is necessary that type variables, whenever created, are different from all other type variables in the system. This is easy to achieve when programming the typechecker, and talking about freshness here would only obfuscate the typing rules. However, a formally correct type system needs to include them (and we may ask you to do everything in a formal way during the exam!).</p>

<p>Finally, the most attentive of you guys have probably noticed that the typing rules above don’t mention <code class="highlighter-rouge">let</code>.
This is not an oversight. <code class="highlighter-rouge">let</code> is a very special case that will be covered later in the document.</p>

<h3 id="intermezzo">Intermezzo</h3>

<p>A fun fact about the type returned by phase 1 is that it’s overly optimistic.
Whenever the typechecker can’t trivially assign a type to something, it makes up fictional type variables and moves on
(see the last two typing rules provided above, namely the ones that say “X is fresh”).
For example, applying phase 1 to <code class="highlighter-rouge">(\b. if b then false else true)</code> will yield the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">X -&gt; Bool</code>
along with the constraint set that has been generated by the typing rules: <code class="highlighter-rouge">[X = Bool]</code>.</p>

<p>Therefore, in order to complete typechecking, we will need to solve the constraints.
This is done by a procedure called <em>unification</em>,
which will tell us two things: A) whether the input is well-typed, B) how to make sense of the type returned by phase 1.</p>

<p>Phase 2 is going to process the constraint set and either produce an error
or return a <em>substitution</em>, i.e. a mapping from type variables to types
that can be used to replace type variables in the type returned by phase 1.
For example, unification of the constraint set <code class="highlighter-rouge">[X = Bool]</code> will yield the substitution <code class="highlighter-rouge">[X → Bool]</code>,
and applying that substitution to <code class="highlighter-rouge">X -&gt; Bool</code> will produce the resulting type of the example expression:
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Bool -&gt; Bool</code> (note the arrows that we’re using!).</p>

<h3 id="phase-2-unification">Phase 2: Unification</h3>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">def unify(c: List[Constraint]): Substitution = ???</code></p>

<p>The unification algorithm works by starting with an empty substitution <code class="highlighter-rouge">[]</code> and then going through
the constraints one by one, extending the initial substitution (i.e. adding substitution rules) as it goes.
Concretely, for every constraint <code class="highlighter-rouge">S = T</code> in the constraint set, the unification algorithm works as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>If <code class="highlighter-rouge">S</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">T</code> are the same type, e.g. as in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Nat = Nat</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">X1 = X1</code>, then do nothing and proceed to the next constraint.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <code class="highlighter-rouge">S</code> is a type variable, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">S</code> doesn’t appear in <code class="highlighter-rouge">T</code>, extend the resulting substitution with <code class="highlighter-rouge">[S → T]</code> and proceed to the next constraint. If <code class="highlighter-rouge">S</code> appears in <code class="highlighter-rouge">T</code>, then it’s a unification error, because otherwise our algorithm is going to loop infinitely.</p>

    <p>A tricky detail here lies in the necessity to apply <code class="highlighter-rouge">S → T</code> to the remaining constraints in the constraint set.
 Otherwise, things like <code class="highlighter-rouge">[X = Nat, Y = X]</code> aren’t going to unify in a useful way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <code class="highlighter-rouge">T</code> is a type variable, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">S</code> is not, proceed analogously to the previous case.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If <code class="highlighter-rouge">S</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">T</code> are both function types, as in <code class="highlighter-rouge">S1 -&gt; S2 = T1 -&gt; T2</code>, recursively unify <code class="highlighter-rouge">S1</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">T1</code> as well as <code class="highlighter-rouge">S2</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">T2</code>, and proceed to the next constraint.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Else fail. This means that it’s impossible to find a substitution that satisfies the constraint set, which ultimately means a type error.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="the-elephant-in-the-room">The elephant in the room…</h3>

<p>By now, you’re probably wondering what’s so special about <code class="highlighter-rouge">let</code> that we’ve been ignoring it all this time.
After all, <code class="highlighter-rouge">let</code> trivially desugars to an application of a lambda, right?</p>

<p>Well, in fact there’s nothing special about <code class="highlighter-rouge">let</code> as a language construct -
we’re just going to use it as a hack to encode special behavior into the typechecking algorithm.</p>

<h3 id="and-the-dirty-secrets-of-language-designers">…and the dirty secrets of language designers</h3>

<p>Let’s recap the current situation. We have a very neat algorithm that lets us completely drop type annotations
from lambdas and have these annotations inferred. Now instead of writing:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>double = \f: Bool -&gt; Bool. \x: Bool. f(f(x))
double (\x: Bool. if x then true else false) false
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can write <code class="highlighter-rouge">double = \f.\x.f(f(x)); double (\x.if x then true else false) false</code>
(please bear with my imaginary syntax) thanks to <em>type inference</em>, which is definitely a useful language feature.</p>

<p>However, our language is definitely not cool enough, because there’s another cool feature
that’s called <em>polymorphism</em>. If our language had polymorphism, we would be able to write
the following code, using the function <code class="highlighter-rouge">double</code> polymorphically, i.e. being able to run the same code
in different contexts:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>double = \f.\x. f(f(x))
if (double (\x. if x then false else true) false)
then double (\x. succ x) 0
else 0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unfortunately, our type inference algorithm can’t handle such a program, because the first usage of <code class="highlighter-rouge">double</code>
will add <code class="highlighter-rouge">X = Nat</code> to the constraint set (where <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> is a type variable introduced for <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code>),
whereas the second usage will add <code class="highlighter-rouge">X = Bool</code> to the constraint, and we’ll get a contradiction during unification.</p>

<p>Now, as language designers, we can’t resist a possibility to make our language more powerful.
We’re going to take an existing language feature, <code class="highlighter-rouge">let</code>, and repurpose it to exhibit the semantics
that we’re currently fond of. As a result, our calculus will become more complicated, our implementation
will become more complicated, and you will have to understand and implement all that.
But hey - it’s gotta be fun!</p>

<h3 id="a-boring-tldr-of-the-previous-section">A boring tl;dr of the previous section</h3>

<p>Our calculus is really neat, but it’s not cool enough. Therefore, we’re going to incorporate
a new feature into it, and we need a dedicated language construct to express that feature.
We don’t want to introduce new language features, so we’ll take <code class="highlighter-rouge">let</code> and make it mean something else.</p>

<h3 id="let-polymorphism">Let-polymorphism</h3>

<p>The way to incorporate polymorphism into typechecking <code class="highlighter-rouge">let</code> is to generalize the type of <code class="highlighter-rouge">double</code> by making it a <em>type scheme</em>. A type scheme is a recipe for creating types, and it works by abstracting over its type variables. Each time <code class="highlighter-rouge">double</code> is used, we instantiate the type scheme to yield a new type, which means that type variables participating in the constraints aren’t going to contradict each other.</p>

<p>A <em>type scheme</em> is: 1) a type, together with 2) a list of type variables that can be instantiated. Instantiation means inventing fresh type variables for each of the arguments of a type scheme, and substituting them with the fresh ones. For example, <code class="highlighter-rouge">TypeScheme(List(a), a -&gt; a)</code> instantiates to <code class="highlighter-rouge">a1 -&gt; a1</code>, and that’s how we’ll be able to avoid contradicting constraints.</p>

<p>To accommodate this intuition, we do the following four steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Change <code class="highlighter-rouge">Г</code>. Previously, the environment contained mappings from names to types, but now it is going to contain mappings from names to type schemes. Each time we lookup a variable in the environment, we instantiate its type scheme and return the result of instantiation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Change the typing rules for lambdas. Instead of binding names to types, these rules are now going to bind names to boring type schemes with empty lists of type variables. Nothing essential changes here - we’re just trivially generalizing the old rules.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not change other existing typing rules. The remaining rules don’t modify <code class="highlighter-rouge">Г</code>, so we don’t need to do anything with them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Introduce a new typing rule that handles <code class="highlighter-rouge">let x = v in t</code> (a typing rule for <code class="highlighter-rouge">let x: T = v in T</code> doesn’t change from project #3). Here’s an implementation sketch (consult chapter 22.7 of TAPL for a detailed explanation):</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>We type the right hand side <code class="highlighter-rouge">v</code> obtaining a type <code class="highlighter-rouge">S</code> and a set of constraints <code class="highlighter-rouge">C</code>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We use unification on <code class="highlighter-rouge">C</code> and apply the result to <code class="highlighter-rouge">S</code> to find its first approximation as type. At this point, the substitution we found should be applied to the current environment too, since we have committed to a set of bindings between type variables and types! Let’s call this new type <code class="highlighter-rouge">T</code></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We generalize some type variables inside <code class="highlighter-rouge">T</code> and obtain a type scheme.</p>

        <p><em>Important:</em> We need to be careful about what type variables we generalize. We should not generalize any type variables appearing in the environment, because they appear in constraints that need to be satisfied. For example:</p>

        <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> (\f.\x. let g = f in g(0)) (\x.if x then false else true) true
</code></pre></div>        </div>

        <p>While typing <code class="highlighter-rouge">let</code>, the environment will contain bindings such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">[f -&gt; X1, g -&gt; X2]</code> and some constraints on them, like { <code class="highlighter-rouge">X1 = Bool -&gt; Bool</code> }. Notice inside <code class="highlighter-rouge">let</code> we use <code class="highlighter-rouge">g</code> as a function on <code class="highlighter-rouge">Nat</code> and that should be a constraint on <code class="highlighter-rouge">f</code> too, which is an argument of the function. Applying this function to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Bool</code> should fail. If we wrongly generalize, we would get a <code class="highlighter-rouge">TypeScheme(X1, X1)</code> for <code class="highlighter-rouge">g</code> which would be instantiated at use to <code class="highlighter-rouge">X3</code>, which would be constrained to be a function on <code class="highlighter-rouge">Nat</code>. Notice how this constraint will not involve the <code class="highlighter-rouge">X1</code> anymore, and the typechecker would miss the type error! The bottom line is, generalizing type <code class="highlighter-rouge">T</code> to a type scheme should only abstract type variables that don’t appear in the current environment.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We extend the environment with a binding from <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> to its type scheme.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>We typecheck <code class="highlighter-rouge">t</code> with the new environment.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="what-you-have-to-do">What you have to do</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Implement <code class="highlighter-rouge">collect</code> aka phase 1 of the Hindley-Milner typechecking algorithm
with support for the entire language explained above, including <code class="highlighter-rouge">let</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Implement <code class="highlighter-rouge">unify</code> aka phase 2 of the Hindley-Milner typechecking algorithm,
again for the whole language. If you encounter an error during unification,
throw a <code class="highlighter-rouge">TypeError</code> exception.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="implementation-hints">Implementation hints</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In this project template, you will be given a working parser, so don’t worry about parsing at all.
We’re also not interested in evaluation, just in typechecking, so you don’t need to implement an evaluator either.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can start small by implementing the initial typing rules that don’t include <code class="highlighter-rouge">let</code> and
extending the environment with trivial type schemes where necessary.
Our tests will check your progress at this stage, allowing you to make sure your initial implementation is okay before moving on to <code class="highlighter-rouge">let</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>While coding the assignment, only change <code class="highlighter-rouge">Infer.scala</code> and
do not change names or signatures of any public methods or classes.
If you do otherwise, your submission may fail to compile.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="development-and-debugging">Development and debugging</h3>

<p>We provide a simple runnner for your application that lets you quickly debug your current implementation. When you implement <code class="highlighter-rouge">collect</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">unify</code>, it should produce results like:</p>

<p><strong>Example 1</strong>:</p>

<p>input:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>\b. if b then false else true
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>output:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>typed: (Bool -&gt; Bool)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Example 2</strong>:</p>

<p>input:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>\b. if b then 1 else true
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>output:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>type error: Could not unify: Nat with Bool
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As usual, we won’t be grading you on the format of console output, your style of prettyprinting or the exact content of your error messages. All examples here are purely illustratory.</p>
